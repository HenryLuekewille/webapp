Outline of the App Idea:
Event Planning Tool:

This app will simplify the process of planning and managing events by providing users with the following features:

Event Creation: Users can create events and customize details like the event name, location, date, and description.
Guest Invitations: Users can invite guests by email or through the app, allowing them to send and track invitations.
Event Details Management: Organizers can manage all aspects of the event, including guest lists, agenda, and logistics.
RSVP Functionality: Guests can respond to invitations directly via the app, and organizers can view a live overview of RSVPs, seeing who has accepted or declined.
Calendar Reminders: Additionally, reminders can be set for both organizers and guests.

Value Proposition:
The app simplifies the event planning process for both personal and professional settings, reducing the time and effort required to organize and manage events. It provides a centralized platform for communication and coordination, making it easy to handle guest invitations, track RSVPs, and ensure that everyone stays informed with reminders.

Goals:
To develop a functional, user-friendly event planning tool with core features such as event creation, guest management, and RSVP tracking.
Aim for a polished, professional user interface with responsive design.
